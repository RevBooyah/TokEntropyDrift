# Research Applications and Theoretical Foundations

This document outlines the theoretical underpinnings, research motivations, and opportunities for academic exploration enabled by **TokEntropyDrift ("ted")**.

## ðŸ§  Motivation

Tokenizer behavior strongly affects LLM performance, inference cost, generalization behavior, and interpretability. Despite this, tokenization is often treated as a static preprocessing step rather than an object of scientific study.

**TokEntropyDrift** seeks to expose, quantify, and visualize this critical phase of the LLM pipeline.

## ðŸ“š Key Research Areas

### 1. **Entropy and Compression in Tokenized Text**

* Entropy as a measure of information density and tokenizer efficiency
* Shannon entropy over token frequency distributions
* Rolling entropy to detect local irregularities or repetition
* Compression ratio as a practical downstream signal (bytes per token, chars per token)

### 2. **Tokenizer Drift and Boundary Instability**

* Tokenization divergence across models (GPT-2 vs T5 vs custom)
* Delta analysis on token count, entropy, and alignment
* Sensitivity of token splits to minor edits (prompt engineering implications)

### 3. **Multilingual and Code Tokenization**

* Vocabulary fragmentation across languages
* Compression/entropy bias in SentencePiece vs WordPiece
* Token inflation in code and markup formats

### 4. **Prompt Engineering and Token Efficiency**

* Comparing prompt formulations via entropy and compression metrics
* Testing token drift with template vs freeform inputs
* Visualizing prompt-edit sensitivity (e.g., inserting a word alters all downstream tokens)

### 5. **Downstream LLM Behavior Correlation (Planned)**

* Linking entropy profiles to model hallucination likelihood
* Detecting prompts with unstable tokenization paths
* Comparing input entropy to output variance (stochastic output volatility)

## ðŸ§ª Experimental Design Capabilities

TokEntropyDrift supports:

* Controlled input comparison across tokenizers
* Reproducible metric exports for entropy/compression studies
* Token alignment overlays and visual boundary maps
* Markdown/LaTeX export for research reporting

---

## ðŸ“¤ Research Output Formats

* Corpus-level and line-level CSV/JSON outputs
* Token-level entropy tables
* Entropy and compression plots (SVG/PNG)
* Markdown summaries with embedded sparklines
* LaTeX table and TikZ-ready graphics (planned)

---

## ðŸ”¬ Future Research Directions

* Vocabulary size optimization via entropy constraints
* Entropy-guided tokenizer training (e.g., BPE cutoff selection)
* Attention span correlation with token burstiness
* Zipf distribution alignment studies
* Drift detection as a pre-training diagnostic
* Tokenization entropy as a feature for reranking or uncertainty modeling

---

## ðŸ“– Citation Use Case (Planned)

We plan to support official citation of TED in the following formats:

* BibTeX entry for research papers
* DOI or Zenodo archive for frozen versions
* Version-tagged results for reproducibility

If you use TED in a publication, please cite the project repository and optionally link example corpora/outputs.

TokEntropyDrift is designed to serve both as a scientific instrumentation layer and a research launchpad into tokenizer efficiency, robustness, and model alignment.
