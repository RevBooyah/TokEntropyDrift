# Advanced Features & Optimization - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The advanced features of the TokEntropyDrift project introduce optimizations to improve performance, scalability, and extensibility. The implementation focuses on four key areas: caching, parallel processing, streaming analysis, and a plugin system.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Caching Layer (`internal/cache/`)

**Purpose**: Improve performance by caching tokenization results and metric calculations.

**Key Components**:
- `cache.go`: Core caching implementation with TTL, size limits, and statistics
- `cached_adapter.go`: Tokenizer wrapper that adds caching functionality

**Features**:
- Configurable cache size and TTL
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries
- Cache statistics tracking (hits, misses, evictions)
- Thread-safe operations with RWMutex
- SHA256-based cache key generation

**Configuration**:
```yaml
cache:
  enabled: true
  max_size: 10000
  ttl: "1h"
  cleanup_interval: "10m"
  enable_stats: true
```

**Benefits**:
- Significant performance improvement for repeated tokenization requests
- Reduced computational overhead for identical text processing
- Memory-efficient with automatic cleanup

### 2. Parallel Processing (`internal/parallel/`)

**Purpose**: Process large datasets efficiently using multiple CPU cores.

**Key Components**:
- `processor.go`: Generic parallel processing framework with worker pools

**Features**:
- Configurable number of workers (auto-detects CPU cores)
- Batch processing for optimal load balancing
- Timeout support for long-running operations
- Progress tracking and statistics
- Context cancellation support

**Configuration**:
```yaml
parallel:
  enabled: true
  max_workers: 0  # Auto-detect (75% of CPU cores)
  batch_size: 100
  timeout: "30m"
  enable_metrics: true
```

**Benefits**:
- Linear scaling with CPU cores for large datasets
- Improved throughput for batch operations
- Better resource utilization

### 3. Streaming Analysis (`internal/streaming/`)

**Purpose**: Process large files with minimal memory usage.

**Key Components**:
- `analyzer.go`: Streaming analyzer for memory-efficient processing

**Features**:
- Configurable chunk size and buffer size
- Memory usage limits
- Progress callbacks
- Aggregated metrics across chunks
- Error handling and recovery

**Configuration**:
```yaml
streaming:
  enabled: true
  chunk_size: 1000
  buffer_size: 65536  # 64KB
  max_memory_mb: 512
  enable_progress: true
  progress_interval: 10
  timeout: "1h"
```

**Benefits**:
- Memory-efficient processing of large files
- Real-time progress tracking
- Scalable to files of any size

### 4. Plugin System (`internal/plugins/`)

**Purpose**: Extend functionality with custom metrics and analysis.

**Key Components**:
- `interface.go`: Plugin interface and base types
- `registry.go`: Plugin registration and management
- `examples/token_length_analyzer.go`: Example plugin implementation

**Features**:
- Extensible plugin interface
- Plugin registry with lifecycle management
- Configuration validation
- Example plugins for common use cases

**Configuration**:
```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  auto_load: true
  plugin_directory: "plugins"
  configs:
    token_length_analyzer:
      min_length_threshold: 1
      max_length_threshold: 100
```

**Benefits**:
- Extensible architecture for custom metrics
- Easy integration of new analysis capabilities
- Community-driven feature development

### 5. Integration Layer (`internal/advanced/`)

**Purpose**: Orchestrate and integrate all advanced features.

**Key Components**:
- `integration.go`: AdvancedManager that orchestrates all features
- `integration_test.go`: Comprehensive test suite

**Features**:
- Unified interface for all advanced features
- Automatic feature selection based on dataset size
- Progress tracking across all processing modes
- Comprehensive error handling

**Usage**:
```go
manager, err := advanced.NewAdvancedManager(cfg, engine)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer manager.Close()

result, err := manager.AnalyzeWithAdvanced(ctx, texts, "gpt2", progressCallback)
```
