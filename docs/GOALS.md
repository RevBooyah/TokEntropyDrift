# Project Goals and Scope: TokEntropyDrift

TokEntropyDrift ("ted") is a scientific instrumentation tool designed to systematically analyze, compare, and visualize the behavior of modern LLM tokenizers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Primary Objectives

* **Scientific Analysis Platform**

  * Provide reproducible, statistical analysis of tokenization behavior using entropy, compression, and reuse metrics.

* **Cross-Tokenizer Comparison**

  * Enable rigorous side-by-side comparisons across BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece, and custom tokenizers.

* **Visualization & Reporting**

  * Output interactive and exportable heatmaps, token boundary overlays, and drift metrics to support interpretability, research, and engineering.

* **Prompt & Corpus Sensitivity Analysis**

  * Reveal how small input changes (e.g., prompt edits) affect tokenization entropy, boundary splits, and drift between models.

* **Tooling for Researchers and Engineers**

  * Built as both a CLI-first research utility and as a plug-and-play system for AI infrastructure and model debugging.

---

## ðŸš« Non-Goals

* TED is **not** a tokenizer library. It does not re-implement BPE, WordPiece, or SentencePiece internals.
* TED is **not** a language model or inference engine. It does not run models or generate text.
* TED does **not** manage training pipelines, finetuning loops, or data labeling.
* TED does not attempt to abstract away tokenizer quirks. It exposes them for comparison.

## ðŸ”­ Future Aspirations

* **LLM Output Correlation**

  * Relating tokenization entropy or compression patterns to hallucination likelihood or model volatility.

* **Prompt Engineering Optimization**

  * Using entropy drift maps and reuse metrics to guide more efficient prompt design.

* **Tokenizer Benchmarking Dataset**

  * Build a standard suite for comparing tokenizer behavior across languages, domains, and encoding schemes.

* **Academic & CI Integration**

  * Generate LaTeX-friendly tables, Markdown reports, and CI-validated output for reproducible research.

* **Plugin Modules**

  * Extend the tool with cost modeling overlays, Zipf distribution diagnostics, or visualization-driven prompt editing tools.

* **Enterprise & Open-Source Readiness**

  * Make TED suitable as an internal LLM tokenizer debug tool or external research utility, attractive to teams hiring for LLM interpretability, infrastructure, or benchmarking.

TokEntropyDrift exists to bring transparency, structure, and scientific rigor to the one preprocessing step we too often treat as invisible: tokenization.
